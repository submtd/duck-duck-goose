# Duck, Duck, Goose!
**Play the classic game of Duck, Duck, Goose on the blockchain. Hatch a goose and win a prize!**

## Overview
All ***Duck, Duck, Goose!*** NFT mints start out life as an egg. When enough eggs are minted, they all hatch, revealing **one goose** and a bunch of ducks! The lucky parent of the gets rewarded with a special prize, and then the cycle starts all over again.

These eggs, ducks, and geese exist entirely on the blockchain and have programmatically assigned attributes such as background, foreground, breed, and generation. While they're all pretty similar, each ***Duck, Duck, Goose!*** NFT is extremely rare!

With each hatching cycle, the number of mints needed to reveal the eggs gets bigger and bigger and the prize awarded to the **goose** holder grows as well! In order to keep things fun in perpetuity, whenever the hatch cycle grows to a certain size, it resets back to the beginning and we can start all over again!

> ***Duck, Duck, Goose!*** is a fun and inexpensive way to have some fun on the blockchain!

### Hatch Cycle
The starting hatch cycle is set to 5. This means that there needs to be 5 mints before the eggs hatch and reveal their final form. After a hatch cycle completes, the cycle is incremented by "1" (e.g. 5 turns into 6, 6 into 7, etc). In each hatch cycle, there will be **only ONE** goose. The lucky owner of that goose will receive **90%** of the contract balance! As the hatch cycles get bigger, so do the rewards! Eventually, when the hatch cycle reaches the maximum of 500, it will reset back to 5 so the game can start all over again.

### Gas Optimized Contract
Gas prices are way too high! We've worked hard to optimize the ***Duck, Duck, Goose!*** smart contract to be as gas efficient as possible in order to keep those mint prices down. In addition, we've set the minting price at only 0.001 ETH!

### Future Plans
Maybe a cheaper version on a cheaper blockchain??
